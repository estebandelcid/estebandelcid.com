          These are some of the projects I built while learning web development.
          Most of them focus on using and understanding Reactâ€”things like
          classic hooks such as useState and useEffect, fetching APIs, styling
          components, and making sure everything is responsive, accessible, and
          written with good HTML semantics.
        </p>
        <p>I still keep and maintain them because they mean a lot to me.</p>
        <p>
          They remind me where my passion for web development really started.
          They keep me motivated to keep learning and improving every day.
