I also collaborate with the design team to bring animations and styles to life just the way they imagined them.\n\nOne of the challenges I’ve enjoyed the most is the animation shown below: it's an interactive table where, as you switch between sizes, the pants move to reflect the change.\n\nAll the credit goes to the designer — I just really love how it turned out!",
